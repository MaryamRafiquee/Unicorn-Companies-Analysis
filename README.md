<br>

**Tools used:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) <br>
**Dataset:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frtgnn/list-of-unicorn-companies)

## :memo: Description
This project was completed as part of a one-month virtual internship, where I analyzed a dataset of unicorn companies to uncover key insights and trends. The primary goal was to provide data-driven recommendations to stakeholders for strategic investments. Through comprehensive data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, I identified high-growth industries, key geographical locations, and timeframes that are conducive to the emergence of unicorn companies. The project also involved using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to perform the analysis and present the findings visually.

  :key: **Key Highlights:**
- Conducted a thorough analysis of the unicorn companies dataset, focusing on industry valuation, funding patterns, and regional distribution.
- Provided actionable recommendations for stakeholders, emphasizing high-potential sectors such as fintech, artificial intelligence, and e-commerce.
- Developed visualizations to communicate insights effectively, including bar plots, histograms, and distribution charts.
- Utilized advanced data manipulation techniques to handle complex datasets, including conversion of funding amounts and normalization of data.

This project demonstrates my ability to derive meaningful insights from data and translate them into strategic recommendations for business decision-making.
